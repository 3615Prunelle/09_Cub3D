# Description
🎉 Welcome to our Cub3D ! 🎉
Take a sit, grab a drink, and be ready to have the time of your life !
But before anything, you may wonder ...
> **What on Earth is this project about ?!**

[...TBC...]

Yup. You read it right.
Yup. We did that.
Impressive isn't it ?
Yeah we know, we're pretty proud of it actually !

And here we are, noboby reads these README files but somehow I'm gonna put a ridiculous amount of time into it. Go figure.

**So what's the goal of this project ?**
[...TBC...]
That was an intense and amazing team work experience that we divided in two strategical sections :
* **[...TBC...]** (handled by Maxi)
* **[...TBC...]** (handled by Sophie)

_Required official description, just in case :_
Minishell is a 42 project where you build [...TBC...]

# Instructions
If you're here, you already know the drill : git clone, make, enjoy ! And ... That's pretty much it !
[...TBC...]

_Required official intructions, just in case :_
### Compilation
Run `make` to compile the project.

### Execution
./cub3d

# Resources
For this project, we used ...
* Google / Youtube / AI and all that jazz, obviously
* Bash as a reference, and all the manuals for authorized functions
* VSCode & GDB to code & debug
* Valgrind & Fsanitize for mem leaks
* Wait, should we actually list all the tools we used during 3 months of research here ? 😅

So what about AI ? You bet ! We spent hours having fascinating exchanges with these, all along the project, but in a smart way.
Here's an idea of the prompts we used :
* Teach me the basics of _that_ new concept and _this_ function
* I'm stuck. Here's my code - help me to find out the solution by myself, by just giving me hints
* Don't provide any answers
* What can I do with the 3 eggs, 2 apples, corn flour and butter I have at home ? - WHOOPS, wrong copy-paste.

However guess what ?! We _(almost)_ didn't use AI for this README * Insert here a sunglasses emoji *

# Additional sections
Do we need an additional section ?
[...TBC...]

Voilà, we wish you a safe journey aboard, au revoir ! Bon voyage !
